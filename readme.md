# My experience setting up a nook e-reader - fighting bitrot.

Terence Eden did the hard work of getting the nook simple touch to act as an information display and documented it in this [blog post](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/02/turn-an-old-ereader-into-an-information-screen-nook-str/) .
However, since the time of writing there seems to have been some bit rot on barnes and nobles side such that some of the instructions don't work. This blog documents my experience. 

## Hurdle number one

Downloading firmware. Some of the documentation muttered about automatic firmware downloads but you can still download the firmware [here](https://help.barnesandnoble.com/hc/en-us/articles/5583185727643-NOOK-Simple-Touch-Simple-Touch-with-GlowLight-Software-Updates under the manual download section)

## Hurdle number 2: Usb device not beeing detected

When I plugged in the nook it started charging, but I could not see the device from a mac. 

This [blogpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/nook/comments/kj0lud/nook_first_edition_not_recognized_by_computer/) suggested trying different cables.
